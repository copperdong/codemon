CODEMON is a simple javascript canvas game meant to teach children as young as seven the basic concepts of programming. 
It does this using draggable and droppable blocks that the student arranges on a board. Blocks represent actions and are 
acted out by onscreen characters starting with blocks at the top and moving down checklist style. Students are tasked 
with trying blocks in different orders or arrangments to get onscreen characters to solve problems and thus give access
to the next level's problem. Each level will tell a little bit of story and feature rewards for succesful completion.

This concept is very simular in theory to the Scratch graphical programming language but differs in practice as it is
more goal orientated and will feature (upon completion) dozens of levels. Levels that convey concepts like loops, if-
statements, variables and objects in such a way that will not overwhelm a child. Currently this project is only a proof
of concept for such a game, a simple demo or taste of what the end product could be if funded.
